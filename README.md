# AE 370: Numerical Methods. Group Project 1.

## Topic
Simplified subsonic rocket dynamics.

## Objective
Accurately modeling 6 DoF rocket dynamics comparable to those of other simulation software/applications, like OpenRocket and RocketPy.

## Purpose
Analyzing impact of fin cant angle due to manufacturing tolerancing issues. Applications to attitude controlled rocket, specifically targeting roll control.

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/dssong2/ae370-project1.git && cd ae370-project1
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To reproduce rocket state result graphs, run the state_result.ipynb file from the start. This will take a while (~10-15 min)

To reproduce error analysis graphs, run the analysis.ipynb file from the start.
